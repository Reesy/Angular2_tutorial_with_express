The Angular2 typescript tutorial 'Tour of heroes' with express

To run the project do the following (in exact order):

In the root folder type: 

```
npm i
tsc --module commonjs
```
This will pull down the required packages in root and compile TS into JS

Enter the frontend directory and type
```
npm i
```
This will be modified later but for now this just makes sure that the frontend code can access its required dependencies

back in root type: 
```
npm start
```
This script will run the server.js in backend
